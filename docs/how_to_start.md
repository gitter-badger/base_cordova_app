###How to start?

Installation supposed you already has installed `NodeJS` and npm packages `cordova`, `ios-sim` for iOS.

It is your responsibility to initialize the cordova project inside folder named `cordova`.

Then you can use folder `commands` for compile and run purposes.

Presumably you can use commands from `/commands/init_cordova.sh` to initialize project platforms and plugins.

Before compile frontend you should run `/commands/install_dependencies.sh`.
